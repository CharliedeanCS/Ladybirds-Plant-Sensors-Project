# Ladybirds-Plant-Sensors-Project

## Project Description
The Liverpool Natural History Museum (LNHM) has opened a new botanical wing. This will feature exhibits that showcase a diversity of plants across different regions of the world. This is naturally difficult to maintain, so the museum has set up plant sensors which monitor the health of each plant. However, this is only configured with a single API endpoint, so the aim of the proejct is to help monitor a plants health overtime, store the historical data and create visualisations of the plants health for the gardeners. 
To do this, the team will:
- Create an ETL Pipeline for the plants sensors data.
- Create long term and short term storage solutions for data.
- Visualise data in real time and view data in long term storage.
