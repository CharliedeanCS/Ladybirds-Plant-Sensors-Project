# Dashboard

This folder should contain all code and resources required for dashboard to run.

# Project Description

In order to easily visualise the plant sensor data, a dashboard was created. This allows the botanists to track specific plants and ensure their soil temperature and water levels are normal. As well as track when they were last watered.
